In case the user knows about the existence of the newsgroup nevertheless, he will not be able to post to or read from the newsgroup.</p> <p>However, please note that the salting for password hashing is using SHA-256, but with a global user-definable salt that is concatenated with the username and password, rendering it less secure than using unique random hashes per password. % WendzelNNTPd does support TLS v1.0 to v1.3 including STARTTLS!</p>"},{"location":"#contribute","title":"Contribute","text":"<p>a</p>"},{"location":"#history","title":"History","text":"<p>b</p>"},{"location":"about/","title":"Installation","text":"<p>This chapter provides a guide on how to install WendzelNNTPd 2.x.</p>"},{"location":"about/#linuxnixbsd","title":"Linux/*nix/BSD","text":"<p>To install WendzelNNTPd from source you need to download the provided archive file (e.g., <code>wendzelnntpd-2.0.0.tar.gz</code>) file.<sup>1</sup> Extract it and run ./configure.
