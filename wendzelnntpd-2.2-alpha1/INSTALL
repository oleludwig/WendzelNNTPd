Installing and Upgrading WendzelNNTPd under Linux/BSD/*nix:
===========================================================

IMPORTANT NOTE: Please note that the entire documentation can be found
in the directory ./docs/ (.tex files and .pdf file) as well as in the
directory ./docs/docs (.html files).

You can compile the latex code into PDF and HTML by using the Makefile
contained in ./docs. However, there should be PDF and HTML files
already present by default. Also, the PDF file should always be
available on the online repository under ./docs.
